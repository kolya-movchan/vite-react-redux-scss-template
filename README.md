# TECHNOLOGIES:

## Vite
Vite: The project was built using the Vite framework, which served as the template for development. Vite is a modern build tool that offers a fast and efficient development experience for JavaScript-based applications.

## TypeScript
## JavaScript

## React
I used React, a JavaScript library, to build the user interface and manage component-based architecture efficiently.

## SCSS
SCSS: It improves code maintainability and provides a more organized and efficient way of writing styles. By using SCSS, I could define reusable styles, reduce code duplication, and improve the organization of my stylesheets. SCSS's ability to nest selectors and use variables allowed for more modular and readable code. 

## Classnames Library
I utilized classnames to manage dynamic class assignments based on specific conditions, enhancing the flexibility and readability of the code.

## npm
npm: It allowed me to manage project dependencies and install various libraries and tools needed for the project.

## Prettier and ESLint
Prettier and ESLint: They help maintain consistent coding styles, catch potential errors, and improve code quality and readability.

## Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub: I used Git and GitHub to track and manage changes in the project, and host the project.The use of Git and GitHub in this project allows for version control, and easy management of the source code. It promotes a structured and organized development process, ensuring the project's integrity and facilitating seamless teamwork.

## Clean and Organized Code
Clean and Organized Code: The project followed a coding style that emphasized clean and well-organized code with proper indentation and consistent formatting. The code was structured in a logical and readable manner, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain. The project also employed naming conventions for variables, functions, and CSS classes. Consistent naming conventions helped in understanding the purpose and functionality of different code components. It promoted self-documenting code, reducing the need for excessive comments and making the codebase more comprehensible.

## Explanation Comments
Explanation Comments: The project incorporated explanation comments throughout the codebase to provide clarity and context for the implemented functionalities, complex logic, or any non-obvious code sections.
